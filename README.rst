thinc: Learn super-sparse multi-class models
********************************************

thinc is a Cython library for learning models with millions of parameters and
dozens of classes. It drives the `spaCy <https://spacy.io>`_ NLP library.
I've only used thinc from Cython; no real Python API is currently available.
